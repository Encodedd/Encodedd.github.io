									<h3 class="major">Be where your customers are - Online</h3>
									<p>It shouldn't come as a surprise that the larger part of the global population spend a larger part of their time online, i.e. on the web. It has become easier for a potential customer to jam your business online than to encounter it at a physical location, office or complex. This is not to say that physical business locations have lost their relevance, but rather that establishing your company online puts you where most of your potential customers are. Billions of people are searching for businesses online to meet their needs everyday. This simply means that everyday you're not online, you probably lose millions of potential customers.</p>

									<p>When your business has a site that contains the physical details of the business such as address, opening hours etc., google and other search engines can provide your business on google maps for people who are trying to move around in a city or region where your business is located. Your business is tagged online and associated with any search or events that have to do with anything your business offers. For instance, if you have run an ice cream serve out company, your business shows up on utilities such as google map as an ice-cream or food hang out centre.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Customer Confidence</h3>
									<p>Putting your site online gives your business a form of credibility to customers. Businesses that have websites are usually automatically considered more serious and dedicated to what they do and offer. The presence of your business website gives customers and potential customers a form of trust towards your business and also emphasizes that your business is established, mean no jokes(unless of course if your point is to make them laugh), and is here to stay.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Look Professional</h3>
											
										<img class = "pictures" src="images/professional1.jpg" alt="Customers browsing online">	
									
										
									

									<p>
										All big companies/businesses have websites. Make your business big by creating a website for it. A website helps you look standard, world class and professional. So, why procastinate?
									</p>

									

									<h3 class="major">Establish the name of your business</h3>
									<p>
										Part of creating a website is getting a domain name for your business, e.g., "www.yourBusinessName.com(or .theProductYouOffer)". This way you own your name online, you own your space on the world wide web. This domain name cab be used as an additional glamour to all your previous branding materials, e.g, the website name can be added to your logos, fliers, banners, social media pages and so on. 
										This also extends to your business having a custom email address such as companyMail@yourBusinessName.com. This can be used to send official mails to clients or any recipient as necessary. Researches have shown that customers regard company-branded mails than usual generic mails.

										Encoded offers the creation of both the custom domain names and mail address as one of its packages.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Rank in SEO</h3>
									<p>
										SEO, acronym for Search Engine Optimization, are a bunch of steps and tricks that optimizes the possibility of your website showing up as one of the first results when things associated with your business are looked up online with any of the search engines such as google, bing, etc. 
										The benefits of this includes multiplied traffic(people who visit your site), global visibility, revenue generation (more on this in the next point) etc.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Income through adverts and adsense</h3>
									<p>
										Once your site is online, you can generate even more and plentiful revenue/profit from the site's existence. The more the traffic of your site, the more people and brands request to make adverts on it. 
										Apart from this, google adsense exists, which alone has been the financial source for the continuous existence of some major sites. 
										A place on your web page(s) is designed to display ads that are given by google. The type of ad and its times of display is controlled by google. Google therefore pays you monthly depending on the number of viewers and visitors to the site.

									<h3 class="major">Other benefits</h3>
									<p>
										As stated earlier, the benefits and oppurtinities of having a website are endless. Some of the other benefits of having a website are stated below:
									</p>

									<ol>
										<li>Having a mailing list: when customers sign up for your mailing list, you can send them mails and scheduled times and when there are new products or updates. Researches estimate email marketing to be about forty times more effective in acquiring customers than <a href="">social media.</a></li>
										<li>Tell your story online: showcase your company's experiences on your site.</li>
										<li>Customers remain well updated about events and product sales in your company</li>
										<li>You can easily get and keep data about how customers interact with your products and use them for improvement analysis. This is usually more expensive when done manually at physical companies.</li>
										<li>
											Mail order and e-commerce.
										</li>
										<li>Better interactions with visitors and customers</li>
										<Li>Cheap polls and interactive forums</Li>
										<li>Online portfolio. Show your awards, testimonies and appraisals to the world on your site.</li>
										<li>Attract new staffs</li>
										<li>Orientation of new staffs: new staffs can be told to explore the business site in order to understand how the business works, its vision and principles.</li>
										<li>Referrals are gotten way quicker than with only physical business locations.</li>
										<li>24/7 availability. Your company is available twenty four hours a day everyday to its customers. This is almost impossible to achieve otherwise or just unneccesarily expensive.</li>
